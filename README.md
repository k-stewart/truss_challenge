# Truss CSV Normalizer

Hello! This is a little Ruby class that takes in and normalizes CSV data. It was built
as part of Truss' engineering interview process.  There are some sample
CSVs in the repo for test purposes.

## Setup
You'll need a terminal application running Ruby 2.5.1.  See [Ruby's
download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for help with
that.

## Running the script
1. Open a terminal
1. Pull down the repo: `git clone https://github.com/k-stewart/truss_challenge.git`
1. Navigate to the working directory: `cd truss_challenge`
1. You can normalize a file in a couple ways. `ruby csv_normalizer.rb < path/to/your.csv` or `cat path/to/your.csv | ruby csv_normalizer.rb` both work.
